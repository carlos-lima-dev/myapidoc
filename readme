# Back End API

This repository contains the source code for API, which consists of a backend developed in Node.js and MongoDB.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Backend Configuration

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd myapidoc
   ```

2. add the `.env` file:

   SECRET_KEY=""
   PORT= 3333
   MONGO_URI = ""
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h
   BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=12
   GMAIL_USER=
   GMAIL_PASS=

3. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend server in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Important Notes

- Ensure that the environment variables contained in the `.env` file are configured correctly before starting the backend server. These variables are essential for the proper execution of the application.
- Avoid versioning the `.env` file in Git. Make sure to add it to the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being included in commits.
